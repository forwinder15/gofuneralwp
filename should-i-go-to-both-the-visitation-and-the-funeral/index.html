<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to decide whether to go to both the visitation and the funeral. You may have been close to the individual who passed but not close to the family or visa versa. What if you are an estranged family member or a close friend of the family but not the departed? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="822" height="796" src="https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bothfun.jpeg" alt="" data-id="22" data-full-url="https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bothfun.jpeg" data-link="https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/?attachment_id=22" class="wp-image-22" srcset="https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bothfun.jpeg 822w, https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bothfun-300x291.jpeg 300w, https://wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bothfun-768x744.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><em>Should I go to both the visitation and the funeral?</em>&nbsp;<strong>When it is appropriate, yes you should go to both. 1. You were very close to the individual who passed. 2. You were invited to attend both. 3. You are very close to the individual&#8217;s family. 4. You have been asked to participate in the service. 5. You are an immediate family relation.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>“We were really good friends”</strong></h2>



<p>This is where most people are confused about whether they should go to both services, I think. It&#8217;s not always easy to know what the family of the deceased expects from the friends of the deceased.</p>



<p>I believe that a good rule of thumb is to remember that a &#8220;visitation&#8221; is exactly what it means. A family has provided the chance for friends, extended family, and acquaintances to &#8220;visit&#8221; and &#8220;pay their respects&#8221;.</p>



<p>Two key phrases to remember:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;Pay their respects&#8221;</li>
<li>“Pay your respects”</li>
</ul>



<p>You want to keep that in mind when thinking about whether you should attend the actual funeral. Some families may find it &#8220;dis-respectful&#8221; and we certainly don&#8217;t want to convey that.</p>



<p>Now, that&#8217;s not to say you should not attend the &#8220;visitation&#8221;. As I said earlier, this is the function of a visitation. The funeral is typically reserved for family and those especially close to the family of the deceased.</p>



<p>If you are not sure if you are close enough to the family to attend the funeral, it may be wise not to assume you are welcome. The key to &#8220;paying your respects&#8221; is to make sure you are indeed being respectful.</p>



<p>So what is the best approach? Go to the visitation and pay your respects to the family of your friend. Do not make presumptions but ask if you may attend the funeral. At this point, simply keep your ears open to an invitation.</p>



<p>In a lot of cases, families are not always aware of all the friendships their departed loved ones had. If you convey the nature of your relationship to them while &#8220;paying your respects&#8221; they may extend an invitation to the funeral.</p>



<p>It may be more subtle than; &#8220;We cordially invite you&#8221;. I would expect it to be somewhere in the ballpark of; &#8220;Are you planning to attend services?&#8221; or &#8220;Oh! We did not realize you were so close. We would be honored if you would attend the service.&#8221;</p>



<p>Every family handles grief differently and even the will of the deceased can influence the nature of the service. But as a general rule, most families do not want to deprive a close relationship of their departed loved one of having closure in any way.</p>



<h2><strong>Do not turn down the invitation</strong></h2>



<p>Now, if you have received an invitation to both services then you need to go. In some cases, the family will have selected special friends and acquaintances they would like to attend both the visitation and the funeral.</p>



<p>If the family has gone through the trouble to do this, then your presence isn&#8217;t simply being requested. In a way, the family is telling you that they would like to share this moment in their life with you.</p>



<p>You will have a special opportunity to minister to the family members in this situation. Your relationship with the departed has earned you the right to be present and to be heard.</p>



<p>This is an extraordinary opportunity for you to &#8220;love your neighbor as yourself&#8221;. You may find yourself in a position to offer comfort through scripture, listening, poems, sharing stories, or simply being a shoulder to cry on.</p>



<p>Lastly, it will give you the chance to have closure in a way you may not have had otherwise. The experience of bonding with your friend&#8217;s family will be something you cherish for the rest of your life. &#8220;Blessed are those who mourn. For they shall be comforted.&#8221;</p>



<h2><strong>“I am very close to the parents”</strong></h2>



<p>You may find yourself in all three of these categories if you qualify for this one. Perhaps you are the best friend of an immediate family member but were merely acquainted with the departed.</p>



<p>In cases like these, it is wisest to simply ask your friend if they would like you to attend both the visitation and the funeral. It would not be wise to assume that is the case. Even if you are best friends.</p>



<p>Having said that, plan to at least attend the &#8220;visitation&#8221;. Again, the purpose of the visitation is to provide friends, extended family, and acquaintances the opportunity to &#8220;pay their respects&#8221;.</p>



<p>If you up and decide to attend the funeral without asking your friend&#8217;s permission first you may cause an unintended offense. In some cases, this can cause problems for your friends with their family members.</p>



<p>As I said earlier, err on the side of caution if you are unsure. There is nothing wrong with asking your friend in private if you may attend both services. I expect it will be the exception that you are told no.</p>



<p>But again, every family processes loss differently so do not make assumptions. I would say you would be right to expect an invitation from a really close friend in cases where they have lost a child or spouse.</p>



<p>In those circumstances, most people want their strongest relationships near them for support. If you find yourself in a situation where you are that person, go and be available the entire time.</p>



<h2><strong>“I&#8217;m a pallbearer”</strong></h2>



<p>What if you&#8217;ve been invited to participate in the service in some way? Then you are obligated to fulfill your responsibility in an honorable and respectful manner.</p>



<p>That would mean attending both the visitation and the funeral. Also, you need to make sure that you are on time, well dressed, and available to the family in whatever capacity they may need you to serve.</p>



<p>There are several different ways that you could be asked to participate in. Here are a few:</p>



<ul>
<li>Greet &#8211; you could be asked to help the family receive guests during the visitation.</li>
<li>Singing and Poems &#8211; you may be asked to sing or read a poem during the service.</li>
<li>Eulogy &#8211; you may be asked to deliver the eulogy</li>
<li>Pallbearer &#8211; you may be asked to be a pallbearer.</li>
<li>Prayer &#8211; You may be asked to pray</li>
<li>Procession &#8211; you may be asked to participate in the funeral procession</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have been asked to participate in the service in any way and you have accepted, then be sure to approach your role with the same attitude of &#8220;paying your respects&#8221; as I mentioned earlier.</p>



<p><strong>The family has given you a great responsibility.</strong>&nbsp;Be very mindful of how you handle yourself. The last thing we want to do is cause harm to a family that is already grieving a loss.</p>



<p>As an added note, if you foresee any event or scheduling problem that will cause you to be unable to fulfill your obligation then you should respectfully decline. There is no dishonor in this. Quite the opposite.</p>



<p>Now, do try your best to attend the visitation any way you can. If your schedule does remain unchanged, request to attend the funeral as well. Being invited to participate in the service has earned you the right to ask.</p>



<h2><strong>Immediate family only, please</strong></h2>



<p>We are going to wrap here. I believe it is wise for all immediate family members to be at both the visitation and the funeral. Now, I say this with grace because some folks do not handle funerals well.</p>



<p>In other circumstances, there may be unresolved conflict in the family as well. In those cases, reconciliation should be pursued before the visitation or the funeral if possible. Not during the funeral.</p>



<p>It is never a good idea to go to the visitation or the funeral if you intend to have a &#8220;confrontation&#8221;. The time to do that is before if you can. Reconcile with whomever, if there is a need to, and then move on.</p>



<p>If you are the type that just can not handle funerals, then it may be best to &#8220;pay your respects&#8221; from a distance or in-person before or after the funeral. Bringing libations with you to help you get through would not be wise.</p>



<p>In both of these cases just remember that you are immediate family and your presence is likely most welcome and desired by the rest of the family. Regardless of the past. There are exceptions of course.</p>



<p>However, as I said earlier, most families do not want to deprive anyone of closure. Especially an immediate family member. Chances are, they are wanting a chance to reconcile as much as you do. Maybe more.</p>



<p>This is a time for everyone in the family to come together and comfort one another and be comforted by those closest to them.&nbsp;<strong>It&#8217;s a time for forgiveness, reconciliation, hope, and love.</strong></p>



<p>Remember, this is your opportunity to &#8220;pay your respects&#8221;. If you keep that in mind, you will make the wisest decision about whether to attend both services or not. Also, never be afraid to ask us your questions.&nbsp;<strong>We are here to serve you.</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. &#8211; Matt 5:4</p>

You may have been close to the individual who passed but not close to the family or visa versa. What if you are an estranged family member or a close friend of the family but not the departed? Let's talk about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I go to both the visitation and the funeral?&nbsp;When it is appropriate, yes you should go to both. 1. You were very close to the individual who passed. 2. You were invited to attend both. 3. You are very close to the individual's family. 4. You have been asked to participate in the service. 5. You are an immediate family relation.\n\n\n\n“We were really good friends”\n\n\n\nThis is where most people are confused about whether they should go to both services, I think. It's not always easy to know what the family of the deceased expects from the friends of the deceased.\n\n\n\nI believe that a good rule of thumb is to remember that a \"visitation\" is exactly what it means. A family has provided the chance for friends, extended family, and acquaintances to \"visit\" and \"pay their respects\".\n\n\n\nTwo key phrases to remember:\n\n\n\n\"Pay their respects\"“Pay your respects”\n\n\n\nYou want to keep that in mind when thinking about whether you should attend the actual funeral. Some families may find it \"dis-respectful\" and we certainly don't want to convey that.\n\n\n\nNow, that's not to say you should not attend the \"visitation\". As I said earlier, this is the function of a visitation. The funeral is typically reserved for family and those especially close to the family of the deceased.\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure if you are close enough to the family to attend the funeral, it may be wise not to assume you are welcome. The key to \"paying your respects\" is to make sure you are indeed being respectful.\n\n\n\nSo what is the best approach? Go to the visitation and pay your respects to the family of your friend. Do not make presumptions but ask if you may attend the funeral. At this point, simply keep your ears open to an invitation.\n\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, families are not always aware of all the friendships their departed loved ones had. If you convey the nature of your relationship to them while \"paying your respects\" they may extend an invitation to the funeral.\n\n\n\nIt may be more subtle than; \"We cordially invite you\". I would expect it to be somewhere in the ballpark of; \"Are you planning to attend services?\" or \"Oh! We did not realize you were so close. We would be honored if you would attend the service.\"\n\n\n\nEvery family handles grief differently and even the will of the deceased can influence the nature of the service. But as a general rule, most families do not want to deprive a close relationship of their departed loved one of having closure in any way.\n\n\n\nDo not turn down the invitation\n\n\n\nNow, if you have received an invitation to both services then you need to go. In some cases, the family will have selected special friends and acquaintances they would like to attend both the visitation and the funeral.\n\n\n\nIf the family has gone through the trouble to do this, then your presence isn't simply being requested. In a way, the family is telling you that they would like to share this moment in their life with you.\n\n\n\nYou will have a special opportunity to minister to the family members in this situation. Your relationship with the departed has earned you the right to be present and to be heard.\n\n\n\nThis is an extraordinary opportunity for you to \"love your neighbor as yourself\". You may find yourself in a position to offer comfort through scripture, listening, poems, sharing stories, or simply being a shoulder to cry on.\n\n\n\nLastly, it will give you the chance to have closure in a way you may not have had otherwise. The experience of bonding with your friend's family will be something you cherish for the rest of your life. \"Blessed are those who mourn. For they shall be comforted.\"\n\n\n\n“I am very close to the parents”\n\n\n\nYou may find yourself in all three of these categories if you qualify for this one. Perhaps you are the best friend of an immediate family member but were merely acquainted with the departed.\n\n\n\nIn cases like these, it is wisest to simply ask your friend if they would like you to attend both the visitation and the funeral. It would not be wise to assume that is the case. Even if you are best friends.\n\n\n\nHaving said that, plan to at least attend the \"visitation\". Again, the purpose of the visitation is to provide friends, extended family, and acquaintances the opportunity to \"pay their respects\".\n\n\n\nIf you up and decide to attend the funeral without asking your friend's permission first you may cause an unintended offense. In some cases, this can cause problems for your friends with their family members.\n\n\n\nAs I said earlier, err on the side of caution if you are unsure. There is nothing wrong with asking your friend in private if you may attend both services. I expect it will be the exception that you are told no.\n\n\n\nBut again, every family processes loss differently so do not make assumptions. I would say you would be right to expect an invitation from a really close friend in cases where they have lost a child or spouse.\n\n\n\nIn those circumstances, most people want their strongest relationships near them for support. If you find yourself in a situation where you are that person, go and be available the entire time.\n\n\n\n“I'm a pallbearer”\n\n\n\nWhat if you've been invited to participate in the service in some way? Then you are obligated to fulfill your responsibility in an honorable and respectful manner.\n\n\n\nThat would mean attending both the visitation and the funeral. Also, you need to make sure that you are on time, well dressed, and available to the family in whatever capacity they may need you to serve.\n\n\n\nThere are several different ways that you could be asked to participate in. Here are a few:\n\n\n\nGreet - you could be asked to help the family receive guests during the visitation.Singing and Poems - you may be asked to sing or read a poem during the service.Eulogy - you may be asked to deliver the eulogyPallbearer - you may be asked to be a pallbearer.Prayer - You may be asked to prayProcession - you may be asked to participate in the funeral procession\n\n\n\nIf you have been asked to participate in the service in any way and you have accepted, then be sure to approach your role with the same attitude of \"paying your respects\" as I mentioned earlier.\n\n\n\nThe family has given you a great responsibility.&nbsp;Be very mindful of how you handle yourself. The last thing we want to do is cause harm to a family that is already grieving a loss.\n\n\n\nAs an added note, if you foresee any event or scheduling problem that will cause you to be unable to fulfill your obligation then you should respectfully decline. There is no dishonor in this. Quite the opposite.\n\n\n\nNow, do try your best to attend the visitation any way you can. If your schedule does remain unchanged, request to attend the funeral as well. Being invited to participate in the service has earned you the right to ask.\n\n\n\nImmediate family only, please\n\n\n\nWe are going to wrap here. I believe it is wise for all immediate family members to be at both the visitation and the funeral. Now, I say this with grace because some folks do not handle funerals well.\n\n\n\nIn other circumstances, there may be unresolved conflict in the family as well. In those cases, reconciliation should be pursued before the visitation or the funeral if possible. Not during the funeral.\n\n\n\nIt is never a good idea to go to the visitation or the funeral if you intend to have a \"confrontation\". The time to do that is before if you can. Reconcile with whomever, if there is a need to, and then move on.\n\n\n\nIf you are the type that just can not handle funerals, then it may be best to \"pay your respects\" from a distance or in-person before or after the funeral. Bringing libations with you to help you get through would not be wise.\n\n\n\nIn both of these cases just remember that you are immediate family and your presence is likely most welcome and desired by the rest of the family. Regardless of the past. There are exceptions of course.\n\n\n\nHowever, as I said earlier, most families do not want to deprive anyone of closure. Especially an immediate family member. Chances are, they are wanting a chance to reconcile as much as you do. Maybe more.\n\n\n\nThis is a time for everyone in the family to come together and comfort one another and be comforted by those closest to them.&nbsp;It's a time for forgiveness, reconciliation, hope, and love.\n\n\n\nRemember, this is your opportunity to \"pay your respects\". If you keep that in mind, you will make the wisest decision about whether to attend both services or not. Also, never be afraid to ask us your questions.&nbsp;We are here to serve you.\n\n\n\n\"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. - Matt 5:4\n\n\n\nArticle contributed by: Jason Coker","headline":"Should I Go To Both The Visitation And The Funeral?","author":"Johnathan Coker","datePublished":"2021-09-20","mainEntityOfPage":"True","dateModified":"September 20, 2021","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/bothfun.jpeg","height":620,"width":640},"publisher":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org\/","@type":"Organization","name":"gofuneral","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/wonderful-kare-161424.netlify.app\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x300.png","height":600,"width":60}}}
